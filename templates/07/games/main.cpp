/*  COMP.CS.100 Project 2: GAME STATISTICS
 * ===============================
 * EXAMPLE SOLUTION
 * ===============================
 *
 *  Acts as a game statistics with n commands:
 * ALL_GAMES - Prints all known game names
 * GAME <game name> - Prints all players playing the given game
 * ALL_PLAYERS - Prints all known player names
 * PLAYER <player name> - Prints all games the given player plays
 * ADD_GAME <game name> - Adds a new game
 * ADD_PLAYER <game name> <player name> <score> - Adds a new player with the
 * given score for the given game, or updates the player's score if the player
 * already playes the game
 * REMOVE_PLAYER <player name> - Removes the player from all games
 *
 *  The data file's lines should be in format game_name;player_name;score
 * Otherwise the program execution terminates instantly (but still gracefully).
